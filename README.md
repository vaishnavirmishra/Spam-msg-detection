## üìå Introduction:-

A Natural Language Processing with SMS Data to predict whether the SMS is Spam/Ham with various ML Algorithms like multinomial-naive-bayes,logistic regression,svm,decision trees to compare accuracy and using various data cleaning and processing techniques like PorterStemmer,CountVectorizer,TFIDF Vetorizer,WordnetLemmatizer.
It is implemented using LSTM and Word Embeddings to gain accuracy of 97.84%.
